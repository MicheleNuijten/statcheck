plot.statcheck <- function(# Plot method for "statcheck"
  ### Function for plotting of "statcheck" objects. Reported p values are plotted against recalculated p values, which allows the user to easily spot if articles contain miscalculations of statistical results.
  x,
  ### a "statcheck" object. See \code{\link{statcheck}}.
  alpha = .05,
  ### assumed level of significance in the scanned texts. Defaults to .05.
  APAstyle = TRUE,
  ### if TRUE, prints plot in APA style
  group = NULL,
  ### indicate grouping variable to facet plot. Only works when APAstyle==TRUE
  ...
  ### arguments to be passed to methods, such as graphical parameters (see \code{\link{par}}).

  ##details<<
  ## If APAstyle = FALSE, inconsistencies between the reported and the recalculated p value are indicated with an orange dot. Recalculations of the p value that render a previously non significant result (p >= .5) as significant (p < .05), and vice versa, are considered gross errors, and are indicated with a red dot. Exactly reported p values (i.e. p = ..., as opposed to p < ... or p > ...) are indicated with a diamond.
