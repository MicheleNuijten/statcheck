Abstract This study documents reporting errors in a sample
of over 250,000 p-values reported in eight major psychology
journals from 1985 until 2013, using the new R package
Bstatcheck.^ statcheck retrieved null-hypothesis significance
testing (NHST) results from over half of the articles from this
period. In line with earlier research, we found that half of all
published psychology papers that use NHST contained at least
one p-value that was inconsistent with its test statistic and
degrees of freedom. One in eight papers contained a grossly
inconsistent p-value that may have affected the statistical conclusion. In contrast to earlier findings, we found that the average prevalence of inconsistent p-values has been stable over
the years or has declined. The prevalence of gross inconsistencies was higher in p-values reported as significant than in
p-values reported as nonsignificant. This could indicate a systematic bias in favor of significant results. Possible solutions for the
high prevalence of reporting inconsistencies could be to encourage sharing data, to let co-authors check results in a so-called
Bco-pilot model,^ and to use statcheck to flag possible inconsistencies in one's own manuscript or during the review process.

Most conclusions in psychology are based on the results of
null hypothesis significance testing (NHST; Cumming et al.,
2007; Hubbard & Ryan, 2000; Sterling, 1959; Sterling,
Rosenbaum, & Weinkam, 1995). Therefore, it is important
that NHST is performed correctly and that NHST results are
reported accurately. However, there is evidence that many
reported p-values do not match their accompanying test statistic and degrees of freedom (Bakker & Wicherts, 2011;
Bakker & Wicherts, 2014; Berle & Starcevic, 2007; Caperos
& Pardo, 2013; Garcia-Berthou & Alcaraz, 2004; Veldkamp,
Nuijten, Dominguez-Alvarez, Van Assen, & Wicherts,
2014; Wicherts, Bakker, & Molenaar, 2011). These
studies highlighted that roughly half of all published
empirical psychology articles using NHST contained at
least one inconsistent p-value and that around one in
seven articles contained a gross inconsistency, in which
the reported p-value was significant and the computed
p-value was not, or vice versa.
This alarmingly high error rate can have large consequences. Reporting inconsistencies could affect whether an
effect is perceived to be significant or not, which can influence
substantive conclusions. If a result is inconsistent it is often
impossible (in the absence of raw data) to determine whether
the test statistic, the degrees of freedom, or the p-value were
incorrectly reported. If the test statistic is incorrect and it is
used to calculate the effect size for a meta-analysis, this effect
size will be incorrect as well, which could affect the outcome
of the meta-analysis (Bakker & Wicherts, 2011; in fact, the
misreporting of all kinds of statistics is a problem for metaanalyses; Gotzsche, Hrobjartsson, Maric, & Tendal, 2007;
Levine & Hullett, 2002). Incorrect p-values could affect the
outcome of tests that analyze the distribution of p-values, such
as the p-curve (Simonsohn, Nelson, & Simmons, 2014) and puniform (Van Assen, Van Aert, & Wicherts, 2014). Moreover,
Wicherts et al. (2011) reported that a higher prevalence of

1206

reporting errors were associated with a failure to share data
upon request.
Even though reporting inconsistencies can be honest mistakes, they have also been categorized as one of several fairly
common questionable research practices (QRPs) in psychology (John, Loewenstein, & Prelec, 2012). Interestingly, psychologists' responses to John et al.'s survey fitted a Guttman
scale reasonably well. This suggests that a psychologist's admission to a QRP that is less often admitted to by others
usually implies his or her admission to QRPs with a higher
admission rate in the entire sample. Given that rounding down
p-values close to .05 was one of the QRPs with relatively low
admission rates, the frequency of misreported p-values could
provide information on the frequency of the use of more common QRPs. The results of John et al. would therefore imply
that a high prevalence of reporting errors (or more specifically,
incorrect rounding down of p-values to be below .05) can be
seen as an indicator of the use of other QRPs, such as the
failure to report all dependent variables, collecting of more
data after seeing whether results are significant, failing to report all conditions, and stopping data collection after achieving the desired result. Contrary to many other QRPs in John
et al.'s list, misreported p-values that bear on significance can
be readily detected on the basis of the articles' text.
Previous research found a decrease in negative results
(Fanelli, 2012) and an increase in reporting inconsistencies
(Leggett, Thomas, Loetscher, & Nicholls, 2013), suggesting
that QRPs are on the rise. On the other hand, it has been found
that the number of published corrections to the literature did
not change over time, suggesting no change in QRPs over
time (Fanelli, 2013, 2014). Studying the prevalence of
misreported p-values over time could shed light on possible
changes in the prevalence of QRPs.
Besides possible changes in QRPs over time, some evidence suggests that the prevalence of QRPs may differ between subfields of psychology. Leggett et al. (2013) recently
studied reporting errors in two main psychology journals in
1965 and 2005. They found that the increase in reporting
inconsistencies over the years was higher in the Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology (JPSP), the flagship journal of social psychology, than in the Journal of Experimental
Psychology: General (JEPG). This is in line with the finding
of John et al. (2012) that social psychologists admit to more
QRPs, find them more applicable to their field, and find them
more defensible as compared to other subgroups in psychology (but see also Fiedler & Schwarz, 2015, on this issue).
However, the number of journals and test results in Leggett
et al.'s study was rather limited and so it is worthwhile to
consider more data before drawing conclusions with respect
to differences in QRPs between subfields in psychology.
The current evidence for reporting inconsistencies is based
on relatively small sample sizes of articles and p-values. The
goal of our current study was to evaluate reporting errors in a

Behav Res (2016) 48:1205-1226

large sample of more than a quarter million p-values retrieved
from eight flagship journals covering the major subfields in
psychology. Manually checking errors is time-consuming
work, therefore we present and validate an automated procedure in the R package statcheck (Epskamp & Nuijten, 2015).
The validation of statcheck is described in Appendix A.
We used statcheck to investigate the overall prevalence of
reporting inconsistencies and compare our findings to findings
in previous studies. Furthermore, we investigated whether
there has been an increase in inconsistencies over the period
1985 to 2013, and, on a related note, whether there has been
any increase in the number of NHST results in general and per
paper. We also documented any differences in the prevalence
and increase of reporting errors between journals. Specifically,
we studied whether articles in social psychology contain more
inconsistencies than articles in other subfields of psychology.

Method
Bstatcheck^
To evaluate the prevalence of reporting errors, we used the
automated procedure statcheck (version 1.0.1.; Epskamp &
Nuijten, 2015). This freely available R package (R Core
Team, 2014) extracts statistical results and recalculates pvalues based on reported test statistics and their degrees of
freedom. Roughly, the underlying procedure executes the following four steps.
Step 1: First, statcheck converts a PDF or HTML file to a
plain text file. The conversion from PDF to plain text can
sometimes be problematic, because some journal publishers use images of signs such as B<^, B>^, or B=^,
instead of the actual character. These images are not converted to the text file. HTML files do not have such problems and typically render accurate plain text files.
Step 2: From the plain text file, statcheck extracts t, F, r,
2, and Z statistics, with the accompanying degrees of
freedom (df) and p-value. Since statcheck is an automated
procedure, it can only search for prespecified strings of
text. Therefore, we chose to let statcheck search for results that are reported completely and exactly in APA
style (American Psychological Association, 2010). A
general example would be Btest statistic (df1, df2) =/</>
..., p =/</> ...^. Two more specific examples are: Bt(37)
= -4.93, p <.001^, B2(1, N = 226) = 6.90, p <.01.^
statcheck takes different spacing into account, and also
reads results that are reported as nonsignificant (ns). On
the other hand, it does not read results that deviate from
the APA template. For instance, statcheck overlooks
cases in which a result includes an effect size estimate
in between the test statistic and the p-value (e.g., BF(2,

Behav Res (2016) 48:1205-1226

70) = 4.48, MSE = 6.61, p <.02^) or when two results are
combined into one sentence (e.g., BF(1, 15) = 19.9 and
5.16, p <.001 and p <.05, respectively^). These restrictions usually also imply that statcheck will not read results in tables, since these are often incompletely reported
(see Appendix A for a more detailed overview of what
statcheck can and cannot read).
Step 3: statcheck uses the extracted test statistics and
degrees of freedom to recalculate the p-value. By default
all tests are assumed to be two-tailed. We compared pvalues recalculated by statcheck in R version 3.1.2 and
Microsoft Office Excel 2013 and found that the results of
both programs were consistent up to the tenth decimal
point. This indicates that underlying algorithms used to
approximate the distributions are not specific to the R
environment.
Step 4: Finally, statcheck compares the reported and
recalculated p-value. Whenever the reported p-value is
inconsistent with the recalculated p-value, the result is
marked as an inconsistency. If the reported p-value is
inconsistent with the recalculated p-value and the inconsistency changes the statistical conclusion (assuming  =
.05), the result is marked as a gross inconsistency. To take
into account one-sided tests, statcheck scans the whole
text of the article for the words Bone-tailed,^ Bone-sided,
^ or Bdirectional.^ If a result is initially marked as inconsistent, but the article mentions one of these words and
the result would have been consistent if it were one-sided,
then the result is marked as consistent. Note that statcheck
does not take into account p-values that are adjusted for
multiple testing (e.g., a Bonferroni correction). P-values
adjusted for multiple comparisons that are higher than the
recalculated p-value can therefore erroneously be marked
as inconsistent. However, when we automatically searched
our sample of 30,717 articles, we found that only 96
articles reported the string BBonferroni^ (0.3 %) and nine
articles reported the string BHuynh-Feldt^ or BHuynh
Feldt^ (0.03 %). We conclude from this that corrections
for multiple testing are rarely used and will not significantly distort conclusions in our study.
Similar to Bakker and Wicherts (2011), statcheck takes
numeric rounding into account. Consider the following example: t(28) = 2.0, p<.05. The recalculated p-value that corresponds to a t-value of 2.0 with 28 degrees of freedom is .055,
which appears to be inconsistent with the reported p-value of
<.05. However, a reported t-value of 2.0 could correspond to
any rounded value between 1.95 and 2.05, with a corresponding range of p-values between .0498 and .0613, which means
that the reported p <.05 is not considered inconsistent.
Furthermore, statcheck considers p-values reported as p =
.05 as significant. We inspected 10 % of the 2,473 instances in
our sample in which a result was reported as Bp = .05^ and

1207

inspected whether these p-values were interpreted as significant. In the cases where multiple p-values from the same article were selected, we only included the p-value that was
drawn first to avoid dependencies in the data. Our final sample
consisted of 236 instances where Bp = .05^ was reported and
of these p-values 94.3 % was interpreted as being significant.
We therefore decided to count p-values reported as Bp = .05^
as indicating that the authors presented the result as
significant.
The main advantage of statcheck is that it enables searching
for reporting errors in very large samples, which would be
infeasible by hand. Furthermore, manual checking is subject
to human error, which statcheck eliminates. The disadvantage
of statcheck is that it is not as comprehensive as a manual
procedure, because it will miss results that deviate from standard reporting and results in tables, and it does not take into
account adjustments on p-values. Consequently, statcheck
will miss some reported results and will incorrectly earmark
some correct p-values as a reporting error. Even though it is
not feasible to create an automated procedure that is as accurate as a manual search in veryfying correctness of the results,
it is important to exclude the possibility that statcheck yields a
biased depiction of the true inconsistency rate. To avoid bias
in the prevalence of reporting errors, we performed a validity
study of statcheck, in which we compared statcheck's results
with the results of Wicherts, Bakker, and Molenaar (2011),
who performed a manual search for and verification of
reporting errors in a sample of 49 articles.
The validity study showed that statcheck read 67.5 % of the
results that were manually extracted. Most of the results that
statcheck missed were either reported with an effect size between the test statistics and the p-value (e.g., F(2, 70) = 4.48,
MSE = 6.61, p <.02; 201 instances in total) or reported in a
table (150 instances in total). Furthermore, Wicherts et al.
found that 49 of 1,148 p-values were inconsistent (4.3 %)
and ten of 1,148 p-values were grossly inconsistent (.9 %),
whereas statcheck (with automatic one-tailed test detection)
found that 56 of 775 p-values were inconsistent (7.2 %) and
eight of 775 p-values were grossly inconsistent (1.0 %). The
higher inconsistency rate found by statcheck was mainly due
to our decision to count p = .000 as incorrect (a p-value cannot
exactly be zero), whereas this was counted correct by
Wicherts et al. If we do not include these 11 inconsistencies
due to p = .000, statcheck finds an inconsistency percentage of
5.8 % (45 of 775 results), 1.5 percentage points higher than in
Wicherts et al. This difference was due to the fact that
statcheck did not take into account 11 corrections for multiple
testing and Wicherts et al. did. The inter-rater reliability in this
scenario between the manual coding in Wicherts et al. and the
automatic coding in statcheck was .76 for the inconsistencies
and .89 for the gross inconsistencies. Since statcheck slightly
overestimated the prevalence of inconsistencies in this sample
of papers, we conclude that statcheck can render slightly

1208

different inconsistency rates than a search by hand. Therefore,
the results of statcheck should be interpreted with care. For
details of the validity study and an explanation of all discrepancies between statcheck and Wicherts et al., see Appendix A.
Sample
A pilot study of social science journals in the Web of Science
citation data base showed that few journals outside psychology include APA reporting style, therefore we limited our sample to psychology journals. As explained above, statcheck
cannot always read results from articles in PDF due to problems in the conversion from PDF to plain text. These problems do not occur in articles in HTML format. Therefore, to
obtain the most reliable statcheck results we restricted our
sample to articles that were available in HTML format. The
time span over which we downloaded articles depended on the
year a journal started to publish articles in HTML. We collected the data in 2014, so we included articles up until 2013 to
ensure complete sets of articles for an entire year. Via
EBSCOhost we manually downloaded all articles in HTML
from 1985 to 2013 from six flagship psychology journals that
represent six main sub disciplines: Journal of Applied
Psychology (JAP; Applied Psychology), Journal of
Consulting and Clinical Psychology (JCCP; Clinical
Psychology), Developmental Psychology (DP;
Developmental Psychology), Journal of Experimental
Psychology: General (JEPG; Experimental Psychology), and
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (JPSP; Social
Psychology). These journals are published by the APA and
follow the APA reporting guidelines. Furthermore, we manually downloaded all articles in HTML from two journals in
general psychology: Psychological Science (PS; 2003-2013)
and Frontiers in Psychology (FP; 2010-2013). In this manual
download we did not include retractions, errata, and editorials.
Finally, we automatically downloaded all HTML articles with
the subject Bpsychology^ from the Public Library of Science
(PLoS; 2000-2013), using the rplos R package (Chamberlain,
Boettiger, & Ram, 2014).1 In this automatic process we did
not exclude retractions, errata, or editorials. The final sample
consisted of 30,717 articles. The number of downloaded articles per journal is given in Table 1. To obtain reporting error
prevalences for each subfield and for psychology in total,
statcheck was used on all downloaded articles.
Statistical analyses
Our population of interest is all APA-reported NHST results in
the full text of the articles from the eight selected flagship
1
We note there is a minor difference in the number of search results from
the webpage and the package due to default specifications in the rplos
package. See also https://github.com/ropensci/rplos/issues/75

Behav Res (2016) 48:1205-1226

journals in psychology from 1985 until 2013. Our sample
includes this entire population. We therefore made no use of
inferential statistics, since inferential statistics are only necessary to draw conclusions about populations when having
much smaller samples. We restricted ourselves to descriptive
statistics; every documented difference or trend entails a difference between or trend in the entire population or subpopulations based on journals. For linear trends we report regression weights and percentages of variance explained to aid
interpretation.

Results
We report the prevalence of reporting inconsistencies at
different levels. We document general prevalence of
NHST results and present percentages of articles that use
NHST per journal and over the years. Because only the
five APA journals provided HTMLs for all years from
1985 to 2013, the overall trends are reported for APA
journals only, and do not include results from
Psychological Science, PLoS, and Frontiers, which only
cover recent years. Reporting inconsistencies are presented
both at the level of article and at the level of the individual p-value, i.e., the percentage of articles with at least
one inconsistency and the average percentage of p-values
within an article that is inconsistent, respectively. We also
describe differences between journals and trends over time.

Percentage of articles with null-hypothesis significance
testing (NHST) results
Overall, statcheck detected NHST results in 54.4 % of the
articles, but this percentage differed per journal. The percentage of articles with at least one detected NHST result ranged
from 24.1 % in PLoS to 85.1 % in JPSP (see Table 1). This can
reflect a difference in the number of null-hypothesis significance tests performed, but it could also reflect a difference in
the rigor with which the APA reporting standards are followed
or how often tables are used to report results. Figure 1 shows
the percentage of downloaded articles that contained NHST
results over the years, averaged over all APA journals
(DP, JCCP, JEPG, JPSP, and JAP; dark gray panel), and
split up per journal (light gray panels for the APA
journals and white panels for the non-APA journals).
All journals showed an increase in the percentage of
articles with APA-reported NHST results over the years
except for DP and FP, for which this rate remained
constant and/or declined, respectively. Appendix B lists
the number of articles with NSHT results over the years
per journal.

Number of published NHST results over the years
We inspected the development of the average number of APAreported NHST results per article, given that the article
contained at least one detectable NHST result (see Fig. 2).
Note that in 1985 the APA manual already required statistics
to be reported in the manner that statcheck can read (American
Psychological Association, 1983). Hence, any change in retrieved NHST results over time should reflect the actual
change in the number of NHST results reported in articles rather than any change in the capability of
statcheck to detect results.
Across all APA journals, the number of NHST results per
article has increased over the period of 29 years (b = .25, R2 =
.68), with the strongest increases in JEPG and JPSP. These
journals went from an average of around 10-15 NHST results
per article in 1985 to as much as around 30 results per article
on average in 2013. The mean number of NHST results per
article remained relatively stable in DP, JCCP, and JAP; over
the years, the articles with NHST results in these journals
contained an average of ten NHST results. It is hard to say
anything definite about trends in PS, FP, and PLOS, since we
have only a limited number of years for these journals (the
earliest years we have information for are 2003, 2010, and
2004, respectively). Both the increase in the percentage of
articles that report NHST results and the increased number
of NHST results per article show that NHST is increasingly
popular in psychology. It is therefore important that the results
of these tests are reported correctly.

General prevalence of inconsistencies
Across all journals and years 49.6 % of the articles with NHST
results contained at least one inconsistency (8,273 of the 16,
695 articles) and 12.9 % (2,150) of the articles with NHST

results contained at least one gross inconsistency.
Furthermore, overall 9.7 % (24,961) of the p-values were inconsistent, and 1.4 % (3,581) of the p-values were grossly
inconsistent. We also calculated the percentage of inconsistencies per article and averaged these percentages over all
articles. We call this the B(gross) inconsistency rate.^ Across
journals, the inconsistency rate was 10.6 % and the gross
inconsistency rate was 1.6 %.

Prevalence of inconsistencies per journal
We calculated the prevalence of inconsistencies per journal at
two levels. First, we calculated the percentage of articles with
NHST results per journal that contained at least one (gross)
inconsistency. Second, we calculated the inconsistency rate
per journal. The top panel of Fig. 3 shows the average percentage of articles with at least one (gross) inconsistency, per
journal. The journals are ordered from the journal with the
highest percentage of articles with an inconsistency to the
journal with the least articles with an inconsistency. JPSP
showed the highest prevalence of articles with at least one
inconsistency (57.6 %), followed by JEPG (54.8 %). The
journals in which the percentage of articles with an inconsistency was lowest are PS and JAP (39.7 % and 33.6 % respectively). JPSP also had the highest percentage of articles with at
least one gross inconsistency (15.8 %), this time followed by
DP (15.2 %). PS had the lowest percentage of articles with
gross inconsistencies (6.5 %).
The inconsistency rate shows a different pattern than the
percentage of articles with all inconsistencies. PLoS showed
the highest percentage of inconsistent p-values per article
overall, followed by FP (14.0 % and 12.8 %, respectively).
Furthermore, whereas JPSP was the journal with the highest
percentage of articles with inconsistencies, it had one of the
lowest probabilities that a p-value in an article was

of Personality and Social Psychology (JPSP), and Journal of Applied

Psychology (JAP); dark gray panel), and split up per journal - light gray
panels for the APA journals and white panels for the non-APA journals
(Psychological Science (PS), Frontiers in Psychology (FP), and Public
Library of Science (PLoS)). For each trend we report the unstandardized
linear regression coefficient (b) and the coefficient of determination (R2)
of the linear trend

inconsistent (9.0 %). This discrepancy is caused by a difference between journals in the number of p-values per article:
the articles in JPSP contain many p-values (see Table 1, right
column). Hence, notwithstanding a low probability of a single
p-value in an article being inconsistent, the probability that an
article contained at least one inconsistent p-value was relatively high. The gross inconsistency rate was quite similar over all
journals except JAP, in which the gross inconsistency rate was
relatively high (2.5 %).

Prevalence of inconsistencies over the years
If gross inconsistencies are indicative of QRPs and QRPs have
increased over the years, we would expect an increase of gross
inconsistencies over the years (see also Leggett et al., 2013).
To study this, we inspected the gross inconsistency rate in
journals over time. The results are shown in Fig. 4.
The number of (gross) inconstencies has decreased or
remained stable over the years across the APA journals. In

Fig. 2 The average number of American Psychological Association
(APA)-reported null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) results per
article that contains NHST results over the years, averaged over all APA
journals (Developmental Psychology (DP), Journal of Consulting and
Clinical Psychology (JCCP), Journal of Experimental Psychology:
General (JEPG), Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (JPSP),

and Journal of Applied Psychology (JAP); dark gray panel), and split up
per journal (light gray panels for the APA journals and white panels for
the non-APA journals - Psychological Science (PS), Frontiers in
Psychology (FP), and Public Library of Science (PLoS)). For each trend
we report the unstandardized linear regression coefficient (b) and the
coefficient of determination (R2) of the linear trend

DP, JCCP, JPEG, and JPSP the percentage of all inconsistencies in an article has decreased over the years. For JAP there
is a positive (but very small) regression coefficient for year,
indicating an increasing error rate, but the R2 is close to zero.
The same pattern held for the prevalence of gross inconsistencies over the years. DP, JCCP, and JPSP have shown a decrease in gross inconsistencies, in JEPG and JAP the R2 is very
small, and the prevalence seems to have remained practically
stable. The trends for PS, FP, and PLoS are hard to interpret

given the limited number of years of covarage. Overall, it seems
that, contrary to the evidence suggesting that the use of QRPs
could be on the rise (Fanelli, 2012; Leggett et al., 2013), neither
the inconsistencies nor the gross inconsistencies have shown an
increase over time. If anything, the current results reflect a decrease of reporting error prevalences over the years.
We also looked at the development of inconsistencies at the
article level. More specifically, we looked at the percentage of
articles with at least one inconsistency over the years,

Fig. 3 The average percentage of articles within a journal with at least

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (JPSP), Journal of
Experimental Psychology: General (JEPG), Developmental Psychology
(DP), Frontiers in Psychology (FP), Public Library of Science (PLoS),

Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology (JCCP), Psychological
Science (PS), and Journal of Applied Psychology (JAP), respectively, the
number of articles with null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST)
results is 4,346, 821, 2,607, 702, 2,487, 2,413, 1,681, and 1,638, and
the average number of NHST results in an article is 23.4, 23.0, 14.4,
14.5, 12.7, 11.4, 9.3, and 9.2

averaged over all APA journals (DP, JCCP, JEPG, JPSP, and
JAP; dark gray panel in Fig. 5) and split up per journal (light
gray panels for the APA journals and white panels for the nonAPA journals in Fig. 5). Results show that there has been an
increase in JEPG and JPSP for the percentage of articles with
NHST results that have at least one inconsistency, which is
again associated with the increase in the number of NHST
results per article in these journals (see Fig. 2). In DP and
JCCP, there was a decrease in articles with an inconsistency.
For JAP there is no clear trend; the R2 is close to zero. A
more general trend is evident in the prevalence of articles
with gross inconsistencies: in all journals, except PS and
PLOS, the percentage of articles with NHST that contain
at least one gross inconsistency has been decreasing. Note
that the trends for PS, FP, and PLOS are unstable due to
the limited number of years we have data for. Overall, it

seems that, even though the prevalence of articles with
inconsistencies has increased in some journals, the prevalence of articles with gross inconsistencies has shown a
decline over the studied period.
Prevalence of gross inconsistencies in results reported
as significant and nonsignificant
We inspected the gross inconsistencies in more detail by comparing the percentage of gross inconsistencies in p-values reported as significant and p-values reported as nonsignificant.
Of all p-values reported as significant 1.56 % was grossly
inconsistent, whereas only .97 % of all p-values reported as
nonsignificant was grossly inconsistent, indicating it is more
likely for a p-value reported as significant to be a gross inconsistency than for a p-value reported as nonsignificant. We also

Fig. 4 Average percentage of inconsistencies (open circles) and gross
inconsistencies (solid circles) in an article over the years averaged over
all American Psychological Association (APA) journals (Developmental
Psychology (DP), Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology
(JCCP), Journal of Experimental Psychology: General (JEPG), Journal
of Personality and Social Psychology (JPSP), and Journal of Applied
Psychology (JAP); dark gray panel) and split up per journal (light gray

Psychological Science (PS), Frontiers in Psychology (FP), and Public
Library of Science (PLoS)). The unstandardized regression coefficient b
and the coefficient of determination R2 of the linear trend are shown per
journal for both inconsistencies (incons) and gross inconsistencies (gross)
over the years

inspected the prevalence of gross inconsistencies in significant
and non-significant p-values per journal (see Fig. 6). In all
journals, the prevalence of gross inconsistencies is higher in
significant p-values than in nonsignificant p-values (except for
FP, in which the prevalence is equal in the two types of pvalues). This difference in prevalence is highest in JCCP (1.03
percentage point), JAP (.97 percentage point), and JPSP (.83
percentage point) respectively, followed by JEPG (.51

percentage point) and DP (.26 percentage point), and smallest
in PLOS (.19 percentage point) and FP (.00 percentage point).
It is hard to interpret the percentages of inconsistencies in
significant and nonsignificant p-values substantively, since they
depend on several factors, such as the specific p-value: it seems
more likely that a p-value of .06 is reported as smaller than .05
than a p-value of .78. That is, because journals may differ in the
distribution of specific p-values we should also be careful in

comparing gross inconsistencies in p-values reported as significant across journals. Furthermore, without the raw data it is impossible to determine whether it is the p-value that is erroneous,
or the test statistic or degrees of freedom. As an example of the
latter case, a simple typographical error such as BF(2,56) = 1.203,
p < .001^ instead of BF(2,56) = 12.03, p < .001^ produces a
gross inconsistency, without the p-value being incorrect.
Although we cannot interpret the absolute percentages and their
differences, the finding that gross inconsistencies are more likely
in p-values presented as significant than in p-values presented as
nonsignificant could indicate a systematic bias and is reason for
concern.

Figure 7 shows the prevalence of gross inconsistencies in
significant (solid line) and nonsignificant (dotted line) p-values
over time, averaged over all journals. The size of the circles
represents the total number of significant (open circle) and nonsignificant (solid circle) p-values in that particular year. Note that
we only have information for PS, FP, and PLOS since 2003,
2010, and 2004, respectively. The prevalence of gross inconsistencies in significant p-values seems to decline slightly over the
years (b = -.04, R2 = .65). The prevalence of the gross inconsistencies in nonsignificant p-values does not show any change (b =
.00, R2 = .00). In short, the potential systematic bias leading to
more gross inconsistencies in significant results seems to be

Fig. 6 The percentage of gross inconsistencies in p-values reported as

For the journals Journal of Applied Psychology (JAP), Journal of
Consulting and Clinical Psychology (JCCP), Developmental
Psychology (DP), Public Library of Science (PLoS), Psychological
Science (PS), Frontiers in Psychology (FP), Journal of Personality and

Social Psychology (JPSP), and Journal of Experimental Psychology:
General (JEPG), respectively, the total number of significant p-values
was 11,654, 21,120, 29,962, 22,071, 12,482, 7,377, 78,889, and
14,084, and the total number of nonsignificant p-values was 3,119,

present in all journals except for FP, but there is no evidence that
this bias is increasing over the years.
To investigate the consequence of these gross inconsistencies, we compared the percentage of significant results in
the reported p-values with the percentage of significant results
in the computed p-values. Averaged over all journals and
years, 76.6 % of all reported p-values were significant.
However, only 74.4 % of all computed
p-values were
significant, which means that the percentage of significant
findings in the investigated literature is overestimated by 2.2
percentage points due to gross inconsistencies.

inconsistent results is 11.1 % (1.4 percentage points higher
than the 9.7 % in the current study). The percentage of gross
inconsistencies ranged from .4 % (Garcia-Berthou & Alcaraz,
2004) to 2.3 % (Caperos & Pardo, 2013), with a median of 1.1
% (.3 percentage points lower than the 1.4 % found in the
current study). The percentage of articles with at least one
inconsistency ranged from as low as 10.1 % (Berle &
Starcevic, 2007) to as high as 63.0 % (Veldkamp et al.,
2014), with a median of 46.7 % (2.9 percentage points lower
than the estimated 49.6 % in the current study). Finally, the
lowest percentage of articles with at least one gross inconsistency is 2.6 % (Berle & Starcevic, 2007) and the highest is
20.5 % (Veldkamp et al., 2014), with a median of 14.3 % (1.4
percentage points higher than the 12.9 % found in the current
study).
Some of the differences in prevalences could be caused by
differences in inclusion criteria. For instance, Bakker and
Wicherts (2011) included only t, F, and 2 values; Wicherts
et al. (2011) included only t, F, and 2 values of which the
reported p-value was smaller than .05; Berle and Starcevic
(2007) included only exactly reported p-values; Bakker and
Wicherts (2014) only included completely reported t and F
values. Furthermore, two studies evaluated p-values in the
medical field (Garcia-Berthou & Alcaraz, 2004) and in psychiatry (Berle & Starcevic, 2007) instead of in psychology.

Prevalence of inconsistencies as found by other studies
Our study can be considered a large replication of several
previous studies (Bakker & Wicherts, 2011; Bakker &
Wicherts, 2014; Berle & Starcevic, 2007; Caperos & Pardo,
2013; Garcia-Berthou & Alcaraz, 2004; Veldkamp et al.,
2014; Wicherts et al., 2011). Table 2 shows the prevalence
of inconsistent p-values as determined by our study and previous studies.
Table 2 shows that the estimated percentage of inconsistent
results can vary considerably between studies, ranging from
4.3 % of the results (Wicherts et al., 2011) to 14.3 % of the
results (Berle & Starcevic, 2007). The median rate of

Lastly, there can be differences in which p-values are counted
as inconsistent. For instance, the current study counts p = .000

as incorrect, whereas this was not the case in for example
Wicherts et al. (2011; see also Appendix A).

Based on Table 2 we conclude that our study corroborates
earlier findings. The prevalence of reporting inconsistencies is
high: almost all studies find that roughly one in ten results is
erroneously reported. Even though the percentage of results
that is grossly inconsistent is lower, the studies show that a
substantial percentage of published articles contain at least
one gross inconsistency, which is reason for concern.

Discussion
In this paper we investigated the prevalence of reporting errors
in eight major journals in psychology using the automated R
package statcheck (Epskamp & Nuijten, 2015). Over half of
the articles in the six flagship journals reported NHST results
that statcheck was able to retrieve. Notwithstanding the many
debates on the downsides of NHST (see e.g., Fidler &
Cumming, 2005; Wagenmakers, 2007), the use of NHST in
psychology appears to have increased from 1985 to 2013 (see
Figs. 1 and 2), although this increase can also reflect an increase in adherence to APA reporting standards. Our findings
show that in general the prevalence of reporting inconsistencies in six flagship psychology journals is substantial.
Roughly half of all articles with NHST results contained at
least one inconsistency and about 13 % contained a gross
inconsistency that may have affected the statistical conclusion.
At the level of individual p-values we found that on average
10.6 % of the p-values in an article were inconsistent, whereas
1.6 % of the p-values were grossly inconsistent.
Contrary to what one would expect based on the suggestion
that QRPs have been on the rise (Leggett et al., 2013), we found
no general increase in the prevalence of inconsistent p-values in
the studied journals from 1985 to 2013. When focusing on
inconsistencies at the article level, we only found an increase
in the percentage of articles with NHST results that showed at
least one inconsistency for JEPG and JPSP. Note this was associated with clear increases in the number of reported NHST
results per article in these journals. Furthermore, we did not find
an increase in gross inconsistencies in any of the journals. If
anything, we saw that the prevalence of articles with gross
inconsistencies has been decreasing since 1985, albeit only
slightly. We also found no increase in the prevalence of gross
inconsistencies in p-values that were reported as significant as
compared to gross inconsistencies in p-values reported as nonsignificant. This is at odds with the notion that QRPs in general
and reporting errors in particular have been increasing in the last
decades. On the other hand, the stability or decrease in reporting
errors is in line with research showing no trend in the proportion
of published errata, which implies that there is also no trend in
the proportion of articles with (reporting) errors (Fanelli, 2013).
Furthermore, we found no evidence that inconsistencies are
more prevalent in JPSP than in other journals. The (gross)
inconsistency rate was not the highest in JPSP. The prevalence

1217

of (gross) inconsistencies has been declining in JPSP, as it did
in other journals. We did find that JPSP showed a higher
prevalence of articles with at least one inconsistency than
other journals, but this was associated with the higher number
of NSHT results per article in JPSP. Hence our findings are not
in line with the previous findings that JPSP shows a higher
(increase in) inconsistency rate (Leggett et al., 2013). Since
statcheck cannot distinguish between p-values pertaining to
core hypotheses and p-values pertaining to, for example, manipulation checks, it is hard to interpret the differences in
inconsistencies between fields and the implications of these
differences. To warrant such a conclusion the inconsistencies
would have to be manually analyzed within the context of the
papers containing the inconsistencies.
We also found that gross inconsistencies are more prevalent
in p-values reported as significant than in p-values reported as
nonsignificant. This could suggest a systematic bias favoring
significant results, potentially leading to an excess of false
positives in the literature. The higher prevalence of gross inconsistencies in significant p-values versus nonsignificant p-values
was highest in JCCP, JAP, and JPSP, and lowest in PLOS and
FP. Note again that we do not know the hypotheses underlying
these p-values. It is possible that in some cases a nonsignificant
p-value would be in line with a hypothesis and thus in line with
the researcher's predictions. Our data do not speak to the causes
of this over-representation of significant results. Perhaps these
p-values are intentionally rounded down (a practice that 20 % of
the surveyed psychological researchers admitted to; John et al.,
2012) to convince the reviewers and other readers of an effect.
Or perhaps researchers fail to double check significantly reported p-values, because they are in line with their expectations,
hence leaving such reporting errors more likely to remain
undetected. It is also possible that the cause of the overrepresentation of falsely significant results lies with publication
bias: perhaps researchers report significant p-values as nonsignificant just as often as vice versa, but in the process of publication, only the (accidentally) significant p-values get published.
There are two main limitations in our study. Firstly, by using
the automated procedure statcheck to detect reporting inconsistencies, our sample did not include NHST results that were not
reported exactly according to APA format or results reported in
tables. However, based on the validity study and on earlier results (Bakker & Wicherts, 2011), we conclude that there does
not seem to be a difference in the prevalence of reporting inconsistencies between results in APA format and results that are not
exactly in APA format (see Appendix A). The validity study did
suggest, however, that statcheck might slightly overestimate the
number of inconsistencies. One reason could be that statcheck
cannot correctly evaluate p-values that were adjusted for multiple testing. However, we found that these adjustments are rarely
used. Notably, the term BBonferroni^ was mentioned in a meager 0.3 % of the 30,717 papers. This finding is interesting in
itself; with a median number of 11 NHST results per paper, most

1218

papers report multiple p-values. Without any correction for multiple testing, this suggests that overall Type I error rates in the
eight psychology journals are already higher than the nominal
level of .05. Nevertheless, the effect of adjustments of p-values
on the error estimates from statcheck is expected to be small. We
therefore conclude that, as long as the results are interpreted with
care, statcheck provides a good method to analyze vast amounts
of literature to locate reporting inconsistencies. Future developments of statcheck could focus on taking into account corrections for multiple testing and results reported in tables or with
effect sizes reported between the test statistic and p-value.
The second limitation of our study is that we chose to limit
our sample to only a selection of flagship journals from several sub disciplines of psychology. It is possible that the prevalence of inconsistencies in these journals is not representative
for the psychological literature. For instance, it has been found
that journals with lower impact factors have a higher prevalence of reporting inconsistencies than high impact journals
(Bakker & Wicherts, 2011). In this study we avoid conclusions about psychology in general, but treat the APA-reported
NHST results in the full text of the articles from journals we
selected as the population of interest (which made statistical
inference superfluous). All conclusions in this paper therefore
hold for the APA-reported NHST results in the eight selected
journals. Nevertheless, the relatively high impact factors of
these journals attest to the relevance of the current study.
There are several possible solutions to the problem of
reporting inconsistencies. Firstly, researchers can check their
own papers before submitting, either by hand or with the R
package statcheck. Editors and reviewers could also make use
of statcheck to quickly flag possible reporting inconsistencies
in a submission, after which the flagged results can be checked
by hand. This should reduce erroneous conclusions caused by
gross inconsistencies. Checking articles with statcheck can
also prevent such inconsistencies from distorting metaanalyses or analyses of p-value distributions (Simonsohn
et al., 2014; Van Assen et al., 2014). This solution would be
in line with the notion of Analytic Review (Sakaluk, Williams,
& Biernat, 2014), in which a reviewer receives the data file
and syntax of a manuscript to check if the reported analyses
were actually conducted and reported correctly. One of the
main concerns about Analytic Review is that it would take
reviewers a lot of additional work. The use of statcheck in
Analytic Review could reduce this workload substantially.
Secondly, the prevalence of inconsistencies might decrease
if co-authors check each other's work, a so-called Bco-pilot
model^ (Wicherts, 2011). In recent research (Veldkamp et al.,
2014) this idea has been investigated by relating the probability
that a p-value was inconsistent to six different co-piloting activities (e.g., multiple authors conducting the statistical analyses). Veldkamp et al. did not find direct evidence for a relation
between co-piloting and reduced prevalence of reporting errors.
However, the investigated co-pilot activities did not explicitly

Behav Res (2016) 48:1205-1226

include the actual checking of each other's p-values, hence we
do not rule out the possibility that reporting errors would decrease if co-authors double checked p-values.
Thirdly, it has been found that reporting errors are related to
reluctance to share data (Wicherts et al., 2011). Although any
causal relation cannot be established, a solution might be to
require open data by default, allowing exceptions only when
explicit reasons are available for not sharing. Subsequently,
researchers know their data could be checked and may feel
inclined to double check the Results section before publishing
the paper. Besides a possible reduction in reporting errors,
sharing data has many other advantages. Sharing data for instance facilitates aggregating data for better effect size estimates, enable reanalyzing published articles, and increase
credibility of scientific findings (see also Nosek, Spies, &
Motyl, 2012; Sakaluk et al., 2014; Wicherts, 2013; Wicherts
& Bakker, 2012). The APA already requires data to be available for verification purposes (American Psychological
Association, 2010, p. 240), many journals explicitly encourage data sharing in their policies, and the journal
Psychological Science has started to award badges to papers
of which the data are publicly available. Despite these policies
and encouragements, raw data are still rarely available
(Alsheikh-Ali, Qureshi, Al-Mallah, & Ioannidis, 2011). One
objection that has been raised is that due to privacy concerns
data cannot be made publicly available (see e.g., Finkel,
Eastwick, & Reis, 2015). Even though this can be a legitimate
concern for some studies with particularly sensitive data, these
are exceptions; the data of most psychology studies could be
published without risks (Nosek et al., 2012).
To find a successful solution to the substantial prevalence of
reporting errors, more research is needed on how reporting
errors arise. It is important to know whether reporting inconsistencies are mere sloppiness or whether they are intentional. We
found that the large majority of inconsistencies were not gross
inconsistencies around p = .05, but inconsistencies that did not
directly influence any statistical conclusion. Rounding down a
p-value of, say, .38 down to .37 does not seem to be in the direct
interest of the researcher, suggesting that the majority of inconsistencies are accidental. On the other hand, we did find that the
large majority of grossly inconsistent p-values were nonsignificant p-values that were presented as significant, instead of vice
versa. This seems to indicate a systematic bias that causes an
over-representation of significant results in the literature.
Whatever the cause of this over-representation might be, there
seems to be too much focus on getting Bperfect,^ significant
results (see also Giner-Sorolla, 2012). Considering that the
ubiquitous significance level of .05 is arbitrary, and that there
is a vast amount of critique on NHST in general (see e.g.,
Cohen, 1994; Fidler & Cumming, 2005; Krueger, 2001;
Rozeboom, 1960; Wagenmakers, 2007), it should be clear that
it is more important that p-values are accurately reported than
that they are below .05.

1219

There are many more interesting aspects of the collected
258,105 p-values that could be investigated, but this is beyond
the scope of this paper. In another paper, the nonsignificant
test results from this dataset are investigated for false negatives (Hartgerink, van Assen, & Wicherts, 2015). Here a method is used to detect false negatives and the results indicate two
out of three papers with nonsignificant test results might contain false-negative results. This is only one out of the many
possibilities and we publicly share the anonymized data on
our Open Science Framework page (https://osf.io/gdr4q/) to
encourage further research.
Our study illustrates that science is done by humans, and
humans easily make mistakes. However, the prevalence of
inconsistent p-values in eight major journals in psychology
has generally been stable over the years, or even declining.
Hopefully, statcheck can contribute to further reducing the
prevalence of reporting inconsistencies in psychology.

double checked each reported error after it had been uncovered. The inclusion criteria for the statistical results to check
for inconsistencies differed slightly between the study of
Wicherts et al. and statcheck (see Table 3).
Both in Wicherts et al. and in this validity study only pvalues smaller than .05 and only results from t, F, or 2 tests
were included. Wicherts et al. required the result to be reported
completely. statcheck had the equivalent, but stricter criterion
that the results had to be reported exactly according to
American Psychological Association (APA) guidelines (in
general: test statistic (degrees of freedom) =/</> ..., p =/</
>...). Furthermore, Wicherts et al. included all results reported
in the text or a table in the Results section of an article.
statcheck did not distinguish between different sections in a
paper, but included all complete results in APA style. This, in
practice, often excludes results reported in a table. Lastly,
Wicherts et al. stated that they only evaluated results of
NHST. statcheck did not explicitly have this criterion, but
implicitly APA reported results of a t, F, or 2 test will always
be a NHST result.
Procedure

Here we investigate the validity of the R program Bstatcheck^
(Epskamp & Nuijten, 2015) by comparing the results of
statcheck with the results of a study in which all statistics were
manually retrieved, recalculated, and verified (Wicherts et al.,
2011).

Descriptives
Table 4 below shows the number of extracted statistics and the
number of identified errors for both Wicherts et al., statcheck
in default mode, and statcheck with the automatic one-tailed
test detection.
Wicherts et al. extracted 1,148 results from the 49 articles,
whereas statcheck extracted 775 results (67.5 %). Even
though statcheck found fewer results, it found relatively more
reporting errors (4.3 % of all results in Wicherts et al. vs. 9.0 %
or 7.2 % of all results in statcheck, without or with one-tailed
detection, respectively). In the next sections we will identify
possible causes for these differences.
Explanations for discrepancies in the number of extracted
statistics
We found that in 13 articles statcheck reported the exact same
amount of statistics as Wicherts et al. In 23 articles Wicherts

et al. found more statistics than statcheck, and in 13 articles
statcheck found more results than Wicherts et al. Table 5
shows the explanations for these discrepancies.
Most of the results that statcheck missed were results that
were not reported completely (e.g., results in tables) or not
exactly according to the APA format (e.g., an effect size reported in between the test statistic and the p-value, or the
results being reported in a sentence). Furthermore, one article
in the sample of Wicherts et al. has been retracted since 2011,
and we could not download it anymore; its 28 p-values were
not included in the statcheck validity study.
Most of the results that were only included by statcheck but
not by Wicherts et al. were results that were that were not
reported in the Results section but in footnotes, in the
Methods section, or in the Discussion. Wicherts et al. did not
take these results into account; their explicit inclusion criterion
was that the result had to be in the text or in a table in the

Table 5

Results section of a paper. statcheck could not make this distinction and included results independent from their location.
Furthermore, Wicherts et al. did not include the two G2 statistics that statcheck counted as 2 statistics. Statcheck also included an inexactly reported F-statistic that Wicherts et al.
excluded, because it referred to multiple tests. Finally, we
found two results that fitted their inclusion criteria, but were
inadvertently not included by the Wicherts et al. sample.
Explanations for discrepancies in the number of identified
inconsistencies
There were discrepancies in the number of (gross) inconsistencies that Wicherts et al. and statcheck found. Table 6 explains these inconsistencies in detail. In 13 cases Wicherts
et al. found more errors than statcheck (with default options).
However, all these cases were results that statcheck did not

scan for one of the reasons mentioned above. There are no
other cases in which Wicherts et al. found more errors. The use
of default statcheck did not highlight any false negatives.
The default statcheck did, however, find 34 false positives
(i.e., it marked results as inconsistent whereas Wicherts et al.
did not). Closer inspection of these cases highlighted four
main causes. Firstly, seven cases were not included in the
sample of Wicherts et al. Secondly, seven of the results that
statcheck classified as an error, but Wicherts et al. did not,
were results in which the p-value was reported to be zero (p
= .000). Wicherts et al. counted this as correct, in cases where
rounding would indeed render p = .000. However, statcheck
counts this as inconsistent, because a p-value this small should
be reported as p < .001, but not as p = .000 (American
Psychological Association, 2010, p. 114). Thirdly, there were
11 cases (in two articles) in which the p-value was inconsistent

inconsistencies found by Wicherts et al. (2011) and statcheck (with automatic one-tailed test detection)

due to a Huyn-Feldt correction, which statcheck cannot take
into account. Fourthly, there were nine cases in which the
reported p-value was one-tailed and therefore twice as low
as statcheck computed.
The discrepancies in the gross inconsistencies between the
default statcheck and Wicherts et al. were due to seven onetailed tests (see Table 7). Because of these one-tailed tests,
statcheck gives an exaggerated image of how many inconsistencies there are in the literature. Therefore, we also inspect
the results of statcheck with the one-tailed test detection.
When statcheck uses the one-tailed test detection all but
one one-tailed test previously marked as inconsistent are
now categorized as correct (see Tables 6 and 7).2 The onetailed test detection does result in six more false negatives, in
which an inconsistent two-tailed test is counted as correct (see
Table 6). Overall, statcheck now detected 56 inconsistencies
in 775 p-values (7.2 %) and eight gross inconsistencies (1.0
%), which is closer to the inconsistency prevalence found by
Wicherts et al. (4.3 % and .9 %, respectively) than without the
one-tailed test detection. In sum, statcheck performs better
with the one-tailed test detection.

We also calculated the inter-rater reliability between the manual coding of inconsistencies and gross inconsistencies in
Wicherts et al. and the automatic coding in statcheck. We
distinguished between three different scenarios: in the first
statcheck ran in default mode (without one-tailed test detection), in the second the automatic one-tailed test detection in
statcheck was switched on, and in the last we ran statcheck

The only one-tailed test that is still counted by statcheck as inconsistent
is a result that is reported as one-tailed and has a rounded test statistic:
t(14) = 2.0, p <.03. The correct rounding of test statistics is not incorporated in the automatic one-tailed test detection, but this will be incorporated in the next version. For now this will not bias the results that much,
since these are rare cases.

with the automatic one-tailed test detection and we excluded
cases in which p was reported as p = .000, since this was not
counted as an inconsistency in Wicherts et al., but statcheck is
intentionally programmed to see this as an inconsistency
(since p cannot be zero and it should have been reported as
p < .001). In all three scenarios we only included p-values that
were rated both by Wicherts et al. and statcheck.
Table 8 shows the inter-rater reliabilities for the inconsistencies and gross inconsistencies in the three scenarios. If
statcheck is ran without one-tailed test detection, Cohen's kappa for the inconsistencies is .71 and for the gross inconsistencies .74. If we turn on the automatic one-tailed test detection, Cohen's kappa for the gross inconsistencies increases to
.89, but it slightly decreases for the inconsistencies to .69.
Note, however, there are fewer p-values that statcheck wrongly marked as inconsistent with the one-tailed test detection
(see Table 5). When both the one-tailed detection is switched
on and we exclude cases in which p is reported as p = .000,
Cohen's kappa for the inconsistencies increases to .76, and
remains at .89 for the gross inconsistencies.

Discussion
In this validity check we compared the results of Wicherts
et al. (2011) with the results of the default version of statcheck
and statcheck with automatic one-tailed test detection. The
results show that statcheck extracted 67.5 % of the manually
retrieved results. The main reason for this is that statcheck
could not read results that were not reported completely or
not in APA style. Even though statcheck included fewer results than Wicherts et al., it found more inconsistencies. These
inconsistencies were mainly one-tailed tests that were counted
as inconsistent. Specifically, Wicherts et al. found 49 of the 1,
148 results (4.3 %) to be inconsistent and ten to be grossly
inconsistent (.9 %), whereas statcheck found 70 of the 775
results (9.0 %) to be inconsistent and 17 (2.2 %) to be grossly
inconsistent. In other words, statcheck found an inconsistency
rate that was 4.7 percentage points higher than the one found
in a manual search and a gross inconsistency rate that is 1.3
percentage point higher. The inter-rater reliability for inconsistencies was .71 and for gross inconsistencies .74.
When statcheck was run with automatic one-tailed test detection, it still found more errors than did Wicherts et al. but the

Behav Res (2016) 48:1205-1226

difference was smaller. Now statcheck found 56 of 775 results
(7.2 %) to be inconsistent and eight results (1.0 %) to be grossly
inconsistent. That means that with automatic one-tailed test detection statcheck found an inconsistency rate of only 2.9 percentage points higher than the one found in a manual search and
a gross inconsistency rate of .1 percentage point higher. The
inter-rater reliability for gross inconsistencies was as high as
.89, but decreased slightly for inconsistencies to .69. However,
since there are fewer p-values wrongly marked as inconsistent
with the automatic one-tailed test detection, we advise users to
use this option when searching for reporting inconsistencies.
The main limitation of statcheck is that it seems to give an
overestimation of the number of inconsistencies in a sample. A
large part of these false positives were due to the conscious
choice to count p = .000 as inconsistent. If we exclude these
cases, the inter-rater reliability for inconsistencies goes up to
.76, and remains .89 for gross inconsistencies (with automatic
one-tailed test detection).Furthermore, the false positives
caused by one-tailed tests are mostly solved by statcheck's
one-tailed test detection. That leaves only the false positives
due to p-values adjusted for multiple testing, eventually
resulting in only a slight overestimation of the inconsistencies.
Herein lies a possibility for future improvement of the program.
In conclusion, since statcheck slightly overestimated the
prevalence of inconsistencies in our study, its results should
be interpreted with care. We also advise against using statcheck
blindly to point out mistakes in a single article. The main two
usages of statcheck are: (1) to give an overall indication of the
prevalence of inconsistencies in a large amount of literature,
and (2) to give a first indication of inconsistent p-values in a
single article, after which the results should be checked by
hand. The final verdict on whether a result is erroneous should
be based on careful consideration by an expert.

up per journal (light gray panels for the APA journals and

NHST results seems to remain relatively stable over the
years in JCCP and JAP. JPSP has published fewer articles
with NHST results over the years. In DP and JEPG the
number of articles with NHST results increased over the
years. The newer journals PS, FP, and especially PLOS
show a steep increase in articles with NHST results in
the last few years.

Number of exactly and inexactly reported p-values
over the years

onward (1994), researchers have been encouraged to report pvalues exactly, so we expected to find an increase of exactly
reported p-values.

Besides the general prevalence of NHST results over the
years, we were also interested in the prevalence of exactly
reported p-values (p = ...) and inexactly reported p-values (p
</> ..., or Bns^, which could be interpreted the same as p >
.05).3 From the fourth edition of the APA Publication Manual

3

Note that the APA advises any p-value smaller than .001 to be reported
as p < .001. These cases could be considered as exactly reported. Our
analysis does not take this into account. Furthermore, statements like Ball
tests >.05^ are not included in our analysis.

Behav Res (2016) 48:1205-1226

We inspected the prevalence of exact and inexact p-values
over time averaged over all APA journals (DP, JCCP, JEPG,
JPSP, and JAP; dark gray panel in Fig. 9), and split up per
journal (light gray panels for the APA journals and white
panels for the non-APA journals in Fig. 9). The average number of exact p-values per article with NHST results increases
for all journals. For all journals except JAP and PS the number
of inexact p-values per article with NHST results increased,
although the increase is less steep than for exact p-values.
