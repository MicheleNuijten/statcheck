# Current working version

## Major updates
* Statcheck now has an option to also extract NHST results that are NOT reported 
in APA style. The specific deviations from APA style that statcheck recognizes 
are:
    * F-tests with MSE values reported between the test statistic and p-value:
    "F(2,25) = 11.37, MSE = 236, p < .01"
    * Square and curly braces around degrees of freedom:
    "F[2, 28] = 2.2, p = .03", or "t{28} = 2.2, p = .03"

## Major external changes
* The variable names from the output of `statcheck()` have changed to increase 
consistency in style and naming. This means that the variable names in the 
output of `checkPDF()`, `checkHTML()`, `checkdir()`, `checkPDFdir()`, and 
`checkHTMLdir()` have also changed.

## Major internal changes
There have been major updates to the internal structure of statcheck. Some of 
the most notable are:

* The main `statcheck()` function has been significantly shortened by 
summarizing a lot of repeating actions into general functions, and by moving 
functions from within `statcheck()` to their own scripts.
* Combine the regular expressions for all separate tests into one main regex and 
write generic functions to parse the extracted NHST results. In the previous 
version, a lot of the regexes overlapped, and many actions were performed 
multiple times throughout the code, which made the script inefficient and 
error-prone
* Update the way that errors and decision_errors are determined. Now, checking 
for correct rounding is done within the error function, instead of in a separate 
function
* Calculate one-tailed p-values more sophisticatedly: instead of simply doing 
p/2, statcheck now actually calculates a one-tailed p-value based on the surface 
under one tail of the appropriate distribution. This ensures that for one-tailed 
p-values, correct rounding is also taken into account
* All documentation and the NAMESPACE are now generated with roxygen2
* The variable names in the output are now based on a file with constants. This 
makes it easier to update the names in a later stage if necessary, without 
having to go through every script

## Small updates
* Don't show a message to warn for the potential presence of one-tailed tests 
and other significance levels. This text was mainly distracting.

# statcheck 1.3.2
<!---searched in commits on statcheck repo: `committer-date:2018-05-28..2020-03-15` --->

## Updates
* Added unit tests for all main statcheck functions
* Make it possible to suppress progress bars and other messages when running 
statcheck

## Small updates
* In `checkdir()`, add an argument to specify whether or not to also search 
subdirectories.
* Take case into account for Q-tests, so 

## Bug fixes
* Close connection after reading html file
* In inexactly reported p-values, statcheck only recognized possible one-tailed 
tests in p < .05, not other numbers. Unclear why. Fixed.
* Don't recognize Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic D as a chi-square
* Take case into account for Q-tests to avoid wrongly considering Cohen's q as a 
heterogeneity test.

# statcheck 1.3.1
<!---searched in commits on statcheck repo: `committer-date:2018-04-05..2018-05-28` --->

## Small updates
* Updates to statcheck report template

## Bug fixes
* Summary function now gives back the Source name (instead of Source number)
* Reset working directory after running statcheckReport()

# statcheck 1.3.0
<!---searched in commits on statcheck repo: `committer-date:2016-12-20..2018-04-05` --->

## New features
* **Q-tests**: statcheck is now able to find Q-tests for heterogeneity (in 
meta-analyses). As always, the Q-tests need to be APA reported. statcheck 
recognizes general Q-tests, Q-within, and Q-between.
* **HTML reports**: it is now possible to generate nicely formatted HTML reports 
with statcheck results with the function `statcheckReport()`.

## Small updates
* Formatted code to improve readability
* Removed text for the help files from the R scripts (the help files are not 
created automatically anymore, and having all this text in between the R code 
decreased readability)

## Bug fixes
* Fixed mistake in error coding. statcheck flagged cases such as "F(1, 138) < 1, 
p = .812" as inconsistent, and opposite cases as consistent, but it should be 
the other way around.
* Changed PDF import function so that statcheck can now also handle files saved 
with double file extensions (e.g., myfile.pdf.pdf or myfile.html.pdf). HT to 
Nick Brown for pointing out this problem.
* Summary function now gives back the Source names instead of Source numbers
* Recognize minus signs in HTML coded as `&minus`
* Fixed bug in `summary.statcheck()` so that it gives back the number of 
articles instead of the article name

# statcheck 1.2.3

## Bug fixes
* statcheck flagged cases such as "F(1, 138) < 1, p = .812" as inconsistent, and 
opposite cases as consistent, but it should be the other way around.
* Fix issue with reading html in a Linux environment by using `useBytes = TRUE`

# statcheck 1.2.2
<!---searched in commits on statcheck repo: `committer-date:2016-08-16..2016-08-17` --->

## Small internal updates
* Updated documentation
* Small updates in NAMESPACE to pass R CMD check

# statcheck 1.2.1
<!---searched in commits on statcheck repo: `committer-date:2016-06-16..2016-08-16` --->

## Small internal updates
* Import packages instead of Depending on them
* Using `message()` instead of `cat()`

# statcheck 1.2.0
<!---searched in commits on statcheck repo: `committer-date:2015-11-12..2016-06-16` --->

## New features
* Make it optional to count p = .000 as an Error

## Small updates
* Adapted plot function based on John Sakaluk's code. statcheck can now plot in 
APA style.
* Removed CopyPaste test; this function checked if the same string of results 
was reported multiple times in a paper or text and flagged it as a possible 
copy-paste error. However, this function wasn't very useful and therefore 
removed.
* Added axis limits to plot function so they won't get cut off when the re are 
no p-values > .5.

## Bug fixes
* Updated regex for chi-square, so that it doesn't match t, F, or r with a 
subscript
* statcheck sometimes read t-tests in old PDFs as correlations, resulting in 
correlations >1. This caused an Error in statcheck, but is now ignored.
* In old PDFs "F(1, X) = Y" gets converted by pdftotext to "F(l, X) = Y". If 
this happens, convert "l" back into a "1". Thanks to Erika Salomon for pointing 
this out to me.

# statcheck 1.0.2
<!---searched in commits on statcheck repo: `committer-date:2014-07-01..2015-11-12` --->

* In the automated one-tailed test, search more specifically of "*one*-sided"", 
instead of "sided", etc.

## Bug fixes
* Fixed bugs in determining correct rounding
* If a result is not an error, it can also not be a decision error (this 
happened in some cases when reported p = .05)
