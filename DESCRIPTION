Description: The package 'statcheck' can search text (e.g., scientific articles)
    for Null Hypothesis Significance Test (NHST) results. Based on the reported test
    statistic and degrees of freedom, statcheck recalculates the p-value and checks
    whether the reported p-value matches the computed one. More details on what 
    statcheck can and cannot do can be found in the online manual: 
    <https://rpubs.com/michelenuijten/statcheckmanual>.
